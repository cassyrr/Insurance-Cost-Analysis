# Predicting Insurance Cost

**Objectives:**

- For an insurance company to thrive, it must effectively balance the collection of yearly premiums with the expenses incurred in providing medical care to its beneficiaries. Consequently, insurers invest substantial resources in developing models that accurately forecast medical expenses.

- This project focuses on estimating the average medical care expenses based on a variety of patient attributes. The goal is to provide reliable estimates that can contribute to the development of actuarial tables. Actuarial tables play a crucial role in setting the pricing of yearly premiums, adjusting them higher or lower depending on the anticipated treatment costs.
